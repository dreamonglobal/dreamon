# About Hanna Swartz

A passionate wife and mother, Hanna Swartz emphasizes listening to the Holy Spirit’s voice. She loves to talk on dreams, prayer, and life as an alive believer in Christ through the transitions of life for 18-30 year olds. She and her husband, Ben, are continual learners of faith, finances, marriage, and family, and how to combine those all while living alive in your calling.
