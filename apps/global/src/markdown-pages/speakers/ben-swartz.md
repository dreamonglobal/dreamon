# About Ben Swartz

After a 2,000 mile canoe trip from Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico, Ben began to believe that anything is possible. Ben has traveled the world and experienced the power of God manifest in the large events that he speaks at. Ben is passionate to see the Body of Christ dream again. He believes that if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives inside of us, then our lives should look different in every way. His favorite quote is “Everyone dies but not many truly live.” His favorite Bible verse is Matthew 19:26,”.... with man this is impossible but with God anything is possible.”
