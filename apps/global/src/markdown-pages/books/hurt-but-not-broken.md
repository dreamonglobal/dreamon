"Hurt but Not Broken" is a book created to inspire. Tyler was twelve when he started getting involved into criminal activity. Being raised by his great grandmother in a rough neighborhood, Tyler felt like there was no hope for him. Over the span of three years, Tyler found himself hurt, alone and locked up behind bars. Thinking things couldn't get much worse, he found himself homeless for close to two years after being released from the detention center. It's a story marked with tragedy, suffering and pain. Tyler believes that while we may feel hurt, we are far from broken.
