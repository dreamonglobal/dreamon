Will the church have a Revival, a Reformation, or will it have a Revolution—perhaps all three are needed? Churches all over America casually pray for revival. They sing about it, talk about it, blog about it, write books about it, preach sermons about it, yet, the air of the church seems helplessly thin. For a good deal of western Christendom, revival is a novel idea but not a perceivable reality. The cry for revival has never been greater—the demand for its powerful effects has never been more needed. Yet, the requirements for revival have never been so neglected. Every Spirit-filled believer knows in their gut something is coming, that things cannot remain as they are for the American Church. That we have somehow missed what we are supposed to be and do. If there is an ounce of prophetic nature left in the American church, she will anticipate and prepare for what is ahead.
