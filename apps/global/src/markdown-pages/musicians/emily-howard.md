# About Emily Howard

Zac and Emily Howard are worship leaders, songwriters, and pastors who joined the Dream On Music Collective in January of 2018.

Zac was raised in Ohio and Emily in Michigan. In 2007 they met and developed a deep love for music and songwriting. They progressed into full-time worship ministry at the Church on Strayer, in Maumee Ohio by 2009. In addition to countless worship sets spent at Strayer, Zac and Emily’s 5-year journey at the Church on Strayer took them from there to tour the US and abroad for worship gatherings, conferences, and workshops.
shared the stage with artists such as Gateway Worship, Ricardo Sanchez, Derek Johnson (Jesus Culture), Desperation Band, Sanctus Real, Matt Hammitt, Jaime Grace, Andy Mineo, Lee Choir, and more. They continue to lead worship regionally and internationally. Their song “Follow” was showcased at the premiere red carpet for the movie “I’m Not Ashamed” featuring Sadie Robertson. Since then, have followed it up with 3 more powerful singles.

Zac and Emily are passionate about people encountering the love of the Father. Their worship leading creates an atmosphere filled with the power and peace of God. Their prophetic worship style is marked by spontaneous moments of tenderness in God’s presence. In August of 2014, Zac and his family transitioned to Canton, Ohio to join Woodlawn Church where Zac & Emily now serve as Worship Pastors. They have 4 beautiful children, Kayleigh, Kiley, Kenzley, and Bentley!
